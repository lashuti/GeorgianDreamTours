                        <h3><b>Horse Riding Tours</b></h3>
                        <p>The mountainous regions of Georgia are distinguished by horse riding tours. Where cars cannot reach, horses can take you. You will meet many such tours in almost all mountainous parts of Georgia - in national parks, valleys, or places inaccessible to cars.</p>

                        <h3><b>Skiing</b></h3>
                        <p>There are many alpine-skiing sports in Georgia. If you visit the well-known mountain resorts of Gudauri and Bakuriani in winter, you will have a chance to ski. At the resorts, you will find the ski runs and infrastructure appropriate for skiing.</p>
                        <p>It is also not long ago that amateurs became interested in snowboarding. It is easier than skiing, but it takes a few days to master. It is also interesting to note that there are different types of snowboarding, which makes this sport more attractive.</p>

                        <h3><b>Zipline</b></h3>
                        <p>Zipline is becoming more and more popular in Georgia. It is a stretched steel cable between two points on which the so-called roller slides down and you move from one point to another. You will meet the zipline both in Tbilisi and in the regions. Its price depends on the location and the length of the zipline.</p>

                        <h3><b>Velo Tour</b></h3>
                        <p>Cycling is one of the components of a healthy lifestyle. The number of people who engage in cycling on an extreme trail is growing in Georgia.

                        <h3><b>Parachuting</b></h3>
                        <p>This kind of sport does not have a long history in Georgia. It involves jumping out of a plane and landing peacefully on the ground after launching a parachute. Parachuting is quite an expensive pleasure, however, if the adrenaline-rush experience is a priority for you, parachuting will induce plentiful adrenaline.</p>
                        
                        <h3><b>Paragliding</b></h3>

                        <h3><b>Air Balloon</b></h3>
                        <p>If you are not afraid of heights, then enjoying panoramic views from 150 meters in a hot air balloon will be an unforgettable experience. It is possible to fly with a hot-air balloon only in Tbilisi, but the number of visitors is always high. The flight lasts only 15 minutes but evokes unforgettable emotions in everyone.</p>

                        <h3><b>Rafting</b></h3>
                        <p>Summer is that time of the year when we all try to discover something new, create unforgettable memories, and refresh ourselves. Surprisingly, all this can be combined in one activity - Rafting.<br>

                        Rafting is becoming more and more popular among the extreme water sports in Georgia. The improvement of the sport is greatly influenced by the abundance of rivers in Georgia.
