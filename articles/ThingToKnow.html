                        Georgia is situated in the Caucasus region, between Europe and Asia. Historically it has been a fundamental region for trade and war. This made Georgia extremely interesting and full of activities and places to see. However, there are a few things to know before traveling to Georgia
                        Georgia is a very mountainous country. The Caucasus mountains distinctly mark it, and it has several peaks above 5000 meters, the highest being mount Shkhara with 5193 meters.
                        However, the most famous is Kazbegi (also known as Kazbek) with “only” 5033 meters of altitude.
                        Georgia is a conservative and religious country. Georgians are mostly Christian Orthodox, Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church to be more precise. It was also one of the first countries in the world to assume Christianity back in the 4th century.
                        Prepare yourself to see a lot of monasteries and fortresses  And usually, they are up on a hill away from everything, so there is some hiking too…

                        ALWAYS CARRY SOME CASH
                        While 99% of restaurants and hotels in the city take credit card, smaller cafes, markets, taxi drivers (if you’re using them in rural areas) and smaller guesthouses only accept cash payment. Lari is the official currency in Georgia and you should always carry some on you – especially if you’re headed to the regions or the mountains.
                        IT’S (MOSTLY) SAFE TO DRINK THE TAP WATER
                        Can you drink the tap water in Georgia? This is always the subject of debate among expats. Georgians love their spring and mineral waters (e.g. Borjomi) and for the most part, tap water is of a similarly high quality. Nine times out of 10 when you’re travelling in rural areas and small towns it will be more than safe to drink the tap water.
                        UNDERSTAND THAT THE DAYS START LATE
                        Tbilisi in particular wakes up late and stays up late. Even in summer when the sun is out before 5am, if you’re on the street before 9, you can hear a pin drop. Banks open at 10am but many people start work mid-morning and continue late into the evening.
                        DON’T RUSH THROUGH TBILISI
                        If you’re starting or ending your trip in the capital, you might think a night in Tbilisi will suffice. While it’s true that you can see a good deal of Tbilisi’s ‘must-sees’ in a day, if you want to savour the city, you’ll need more time than that.
                        Tbilisi is the capital of course, but it doesn’t necessarily feel like it. Where other big cities are anonymous and cookie-cutter, Tbilisi has a very unique look and atmosphere that I can’t really compare to anywhere else. This has long been the most multicultural city in the region and all that wonderful diversity still shines through today.
                        MAKE SURE YOU DO AT LEAST ONE HIKE
                        Even as a bonafide non-hiker, I can say this with absolute confidence: You must get out on foot in the mountains, even if it’s just for a half-day trek.
                        Many people come to Georgia for the sole purpose of hiking. The Mestia to Ushguli trail in Svaneti is arguably the most popular multi-day hike, but there are trails in every national park. Black Rock Lake in Lagodekhi, the Truso Valley near Kazbegi and St Andrews Trail near Borjomi are all great alternative options. If you’re serious about hiking, have a look at the Transcaucasian Trail, a route-in-progress that will soon connect the whole South Caucasus region.
                        LOOK BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS
                        We all know Georgia has majestic mountains, but did you know there’s also mud volcanoes, rainbow hills, volcanic plateaus and primordial Colchic forests in Georgia – sometimes all within the same region?
                        For a country of its size, Georgia is incredibly diverse in terms of the climate and landscape. Wake up in the mountains, off-road through a semi-desert then eat dinner on a black-sand beach – it’s possible in Georgia.
                        UNDERSTAND THE DRESS CODE FOR VISITING RELIGIOUS SITES
                        There is a strict dress code for visiting Orthodox churches, monasteries and convents in Georgia. The same applies for mosques.
                        For men, this means covered knees (no shorts) and covered shoulders (no singlet tops). Women must cover their shoulders and knees as well, and cover their hair. Some churches in rural areas require women to be wearing a long skirt rather than fitted pants. In my experience, a long jacket that’s zipped up will do.

                        DON’T SKIP THE WINE REGION
                        Cultivating grapes, fermenting wine and raising a glass of Saperavi at a Supra feast are all fundamental aspects of Georgian identity. Just as you can’t visit the country without seeing a few monasteries, no trip to ‘the cradle of wine’ is complete without a jaunt through the wine region.
                        Kakheti might be the biggest, most productive and most popular wine route, but there are vineyards all over Georgia. Maranis (cellars) in Imereti (outside Kutaisi), Upper Adjara (a day trip from Batumi) and Racha all showcase traditional winemaking methods.
                        You don’t go to a winery just to drink wine – you also go to learn about Qvevri technology, Georgia’s 8000-year tradition of fermenting grapes underground in clay vessels. Even if you don’t drink alcohol or you have no interest in wine, it’s an opportunity for a hands-on lesson in Georgian culture.
                        Food in georgia
                        If you are a big foodie and love trying different cuisines, then Georgia won’t disappoint you. Even though it’s heavy on meat and pastry, there’s a big variety of vegetarian dishes as well.
                        Khinkali is a dumpling with a filling consisting of only minced meat with herbs (originally). However, you can find many alternative fillings to meat, like cheese, potato, or mushroom. It’s freaking good! Juicy, tasty, and yummy all the way!
                        Khachapuri is the staple food of Georgia, and it’s simply a dish of cheese-filled bread. The filling contains cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly sulguni), eggs, butter, and other ingredients.

                        It has several variations, but the most famous ones are the Adjaran Khachapuri and the Imerulian Khachapuri.
                        Cheese, bread, butter… how could it be anything but amazing? Be aware that it’s very filling too
                        Georgia is quite famous for its quality mineral water, particularly the Borjomi (carbonated) and Bakuriani (plain). In Borjomi, you can fill your bottle with it for free; however, it isn’t the same as you buy in supermarkets.

                        If you are tired of visiting monasteries and old castles, you may want to shuffle things and visit the weird Stalin Museum…
                        Stalin was born in Gori, Georgia, and in the museum, you can visit his birth house, his train carriage, and many documents and photos.
